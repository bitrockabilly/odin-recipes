"Building a websit using basic HTML with Git commits and Github repo I made earlier using terminal and VSCode via my SSH key. I expect to be able to hone my skillsets of website creation, coding using html, creating good folder structure and naming conventions, using good practice in commit messages with understandable messages for future when working with other developers."
